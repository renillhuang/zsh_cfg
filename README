This is Eric's personal configuration of zsh
Please rename <oh-my-zsh> and <zshrc> with . prefix under "~/" directory

Change default shell to zsh:
  chsh -s $(which zsh)

Display current shell
  echo $0

Find where zsh locates
  which zsh

Install "oh My ZSH"
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

Change theme, find environment variable, "ZSH_THEME"
  vi ~/.zshrc

Install Powerline fonts for theme "agnoster", and
change the terminal font setting  "Meslo LG DZ for Powerline" font.
  git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git
